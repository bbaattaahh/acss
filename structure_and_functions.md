# Find the asparagus
    in-progress
    1. Dummy versoion : filter by summa, horizontally and vertically
    2. mouving avarage by the pixel posotion
    3. Get the numeric derivalt
    4. Get the min and max value of it
    5. Apply safety band

# Classification of the found asparagus
    1. calculate the characteristic parameters, bounding box

# Print the result to the image

# Display the correc image delayed
    LATER, it is real time now
